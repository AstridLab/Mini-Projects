Mini Data Science Projects

This repository contains beginner-to-intermediate data science projects, showcasing data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and applied insights. These projects demonstrate my ability to work with real-world datasets and extract meaningful information.

Projects
1. Wine Quality Analysis

Folder: WineProject

Objective: Explore wine chemical properties and quality ratings.

Skills Demonstrated: Data cleaning, visualization, basic correlation analysis.

Overview: Analyzed the distribution of wine quality, plotted relationships between chemical properties and quality scores, and drew conclusions about factors influencing wine quality.


2. Healthcare Data Analysis

Folder: Patient_Demographics_and_Hospital_Trends

Objective: Analyze hospital admissions, patient demographics, medical conditions, and trends.

Skills Demonstrated: Data cleaning, time-series analysis, grouping, visualization, applied insights for healthcare management.

Overview: Explored age distribution, common medical conditions, monthly hospital admissions, and compared trends by hospital and admission type.

3. Hospital Length of Stay Prediction

Overview
This mini project predicts patient length of stay in a hospital using a sample healthcare dataset. It demonstrates:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding
- Linear Regression model training
- Model evaluation (Mean Squared Error)
- Visualization of predicted vs actual values

How to run
1. Open `Hospital_LengthOfStay_Project.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Upload the CSV dataset when prompted.
3. Run all cells from top to bottom.

 Key Findings
- Mean Squared Error: 2.39
- Predictions are on average within ~1.55 days of actual length of stay.
- Features like gender, dialysis stage, asthma, and iron deficiency contribute to predicting stay duration.
 

Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) in your preferred environment (Jupyter Lab, VS Code, or Google Colab).

Make sure the dataset CSV file is in the same folder as the notebook.

Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
