# Wine Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores how physicochemical properties of wine relate to their quality ratings. Using data analysis and logistic regression modeling, the project investigates which chemical features are most influential in determining wine quality.

## Folder Structure
- `code/` : Jupyter notebooks and scripts for data exploration, visualization, and modeling.
- `data/` : Datasets used in the analysis.
- `results/` : Output files, charts, and processed results.

## Mini Conclusion
- Alcohol content seems positively correlated with wine quality.  
- Chemical properties such as acidity and pH may influence perceived taste.  
- The logistic regression model achieved ~57% accuracy, performing best on wines with mid-range quality (5â€“6) and less accurately on extreme ratings (3 and 8).  
- Overall, this analysis demonstrates how chemical features can help predict wine quality and provides a baseline for further modeling improvements.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook(s) in the `code/` folder.  
2. Ensure datasets in `data/` are present.  
3. Run the scripts to reproduce the results in `results/`.
